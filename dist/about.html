            I am a Kenyan citizen by birth and Finnish by naturalization. I attended my lower schools, high school and completed my bachelor of chemical engineering degree in Kenya, graduating from Moi University in 2007. I then worked for three years at the Kenya National Cleaner Production Center (KNCPC) as a process engineer up until August 2010, before proceeding for my masters' degree in Finland. Graduating in 2012, I accepted a doctoral position at Lappeenranta University of Technology (LUT) early 2013. As a graduate student, I also worked as a researcher at the <a href="https://www.lut.fi/web/en/" style="color: #eece1a">School of Engineering Science</a>. I graduated in the summer of 2017 with a Ph.D. in Chemical & Process Engineering before taking up a job as a development engineer (materials & equipment) at Fimatec Oy. Fimatec is a start-up company in Imatra working towards developing robotic 3D printers for concrete panels. I have since left FIMATEC to pursue own interests and explore what has greatly interested me in the following technological areas:

          <p align="justify">
            Back in my school days, I mastered the use of neural networks for prediction and analytics and my interest in it is only growing exponentially since then. In these last few years, I have decided to push it further and include blockchain development, particularly creation and applications of cryptocurrency using open source codes such as Ethereum and BitCoin. With ready codes for the coin, I am currently working towards creating a community that can utilize the tokens. This is a long-term project that I intend to oversee it to its logical conclusion. Some working example codes can be found under <a href="./work.html" style="color: #eece1a">my work</a> and on my github repository. Feel free to compile the codes and and use them to issue your tokens.

            I currently belong to a team behind the development of an e-sports gaming platform that is set to launch in a few months time. Under this project, I wear many hats both as a developer and as an assistant administrator. We are developing a secure, state-of-the-art e-sports gaming platform that allows video game players to organize wagering in games such as counter strike, league of legends, Dota 2 and more. Feel free check out <a href="https://inzpirogaming.com" style="color:#eece1a">the project</a> and make sure to join the email subscription list in order to follow up on our work. We are open for collaborations, hire us, let us hire you and help us build together. Together we stand!

          <p align="justify">
            I am fascinated by the deep truths of natural sciences, mathematics, and philosophy of everyday objects. I, therefore, find joy in sharing what I have learned over the last several years of academics and industry experiences. I have since written a number of <a href="https://scholar.google.fi/citations?user=IJRM18YAAAAJ&hl=en" style="color: #eece1a">peer-reviewed publications</a> mainly in process engineering, mathematics, and theoretical physics. Over the last three years I managed to put together a book titled "Mathematical Physics in Science & Engineering" which is available on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1722009926" style="color: #eece1a">Amazon</a> as a paperback, as well as a digital copy in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07LDTJY27" style="color: #eece1a">Kindle</a> edition form. Feel free to check out and make use of these resources.
